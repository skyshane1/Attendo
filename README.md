# Attendo
An attendance application designed to track campus event attendance for UMW.

# Installation 
Download the appropriate release for your operating system and unzip the file into a folder of your choosing. Make sure that the swipes.sqlite file is always in the same file as the Attendo.jar. If the application does not run please make sure you have the latest version of Java installed on your machine.

# Usage
Each function can be reached through the main menu screen. When selecting swipes, click on the text entry bar, plug in the scanner, and swipe cards. You may need to swipe multiple times as the scanner can be finicky but this will ensure the validity of the data. If you need to manually enter an id type it in with the three 0's at the beginning and then press enter. Once you're done press the export button and an excel sheet with the data will be created in the folder with the program. When selecting import, click "Select File" to open a file explorer then select all the excel sheets you want to import. Once selected "Insert Data" and wait until the text prompt says the process has been complete. When selecting view you can sort columns by ascending and descending values and the clear database button allows you to wipe the database to start fresh for the next semester.
